# Customer Retention Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze customer retention metrics. The dashboard provides insights into key factors influencing customer churn, including contract types, payment methods, and support services. It was developed to help retention managers and other stakeholders identify opportunities to improve customer retention and reduce churn.

## Features

### 1. **Churn Rate Analysis**
   - **Churn Rate by Online Services**: Shows the impact of `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, and `TechSupport` on customer churn rates.
   - **Overall Churn Rate**: Displays the percentage of customers who have churned, providing a quick snapshot of retention performance.

### 2. **Revenue Analysis**
   - **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by Contract Type**: Compares the MRR generated by customers on different contract terms (Month-to-Month, One-Year).
   - **Monthly Recurring Revenue by Gender**: Breaks down MRR by gender, highlighting differences in revenue generation.

### 3. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**
   - **CLTV by Gender**: Shows the lifetime value of customers segmented by gender, offering insights into which segments are more valuable.

### 4. **Tenure Analysis**
   - **Average Tenure by Payment Method**: Analyzes how different payment methods impact the average length of customer tenure.

### 5. **Support Interaction**
   - **Total Support Tickets**: Visualizes the total number of support tickets, indicating the level of customer engagement with support services.

## Key Insights

- **Higher Churn Risk with Month-to-Month Contracts**: Customers on month-to-month contracts contribute the most to revenue but are at a higher risk of churning.
- **Online Services are Crucial for Retention**: Customers who subscribe to `OnlineSecurity` and `TechSupport` services have a significantly lower churn rate.
- **Payment Methods Impact Tenure**: Automatic payment methods, like credit card and bank transfer, are associated with longer customer tenures.

## Recommendations

1. **Encourage Long-Term Contracts**: Consider offering incentives for customers to switch from month-to-month contracts to longer-term options.
2. **Enhance Online Services**: Increase the promotion of `OnlineSecurity` and `TechSupport` services to reduce churn.
